# What is MeteoCal? #

MeteoCal is a weather-based online calendar for the "Software engineer" course.

The purpose of the calendar is to make easy to handle events with the possibility to create, modify and delete them. During the creation is possible to send invitations to other registered users. 

The system can automatically provide weather forecast for every outside event and notifies it in time.

Furthermore, it is possible to make a calendar or single events public, in such a way everyone can see incoming events.
